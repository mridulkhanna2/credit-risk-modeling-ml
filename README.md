# Credit Risk Modeling  

## 📌 Problem  
Financial institutions often misclassify borrower risk, leading to higher default rates and inequitable lending decisions.  

## 💡 Solution  
We developed and compared multiple machine learning algorithms on a large-scale credit dataset of **26K+ records**.  
- Advanced preprocessing and feature engineering.  
- Hyperparameter tuning and ensemble methods (Decision Trees, Random Forest, XGBoost).  
- Evaluated using accuracy, F1-score, and AUC-ROC.  

## 🚀 Impact  
- Achieved **97.7% accuracy, F1-score of 0.97, and AUC-ROC of 0.998**.  
- Significantly improved recall for at-risk borrowers.  
- Provided insights into **income and occupation trends**, enabling fairer and more robust credit scoring.  

## ⚙️ Tech Stack  
- Python, scikit-learn, pandas, numpy  
- XGBoost, Decision Trees, Random Forest  
- Jupyter Notebook
